# Privy Authentication Integration - Basetok

## Overview
We've successfully integrated Privy authentication into Basetok, providing users with multiple secure login options including email, social accounts, and crypto wallets.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration (`config/privy.ts`)
- **Theme**: Dark theme matching Basetok's design
- **Login Methods**: Email, wallet, Google, Twitter, Farcaster
- **Embedded Wallets**: Auto-create for users without wallets
- **Supported Chains**: Base mainnet and Base Sepolia testnet
- **Default Chain**: Base mainnet

### 2. Environment Variables
Added to `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=clz8vwq1s0bhkl17s8eg56kpn
```

### 3. Components Created

#### `components/PrivyWrapper.tsx`
- Wraps the entire app with PrivyProvider
- Handles Privy initialization and configuration
- Error handling for missing app ID

#### `components/PrivyAuth.tsx`
- Main authentication component
- Handles login/logout flows
- Displays authentication status and user info
- Shows multiple authentication options

### 4. Layout Integration (`app/layout.tsx`)
```tsx
<PrivyWrapper>
  <WalletProvider>
    {children}
  </WalletProvider>
</PrivyWrapper>
```

### 5. Player Data Integration
- Enhanced Player type to include `privyProfile`
- Player creation now uses Privy user data
- Smart name generation from authentication method:
  - Farcaster: `@username`
  - Email: `email_prefix`
  - Wallet: `Player_${wallet.slice(0, 6)}`

### 6. Authentication Flow
1. User visits the app
2. If no player exists, show Privy auth options
3. User selects authentication method (email, social, wallet)
4. Privy handles the authentication flow
5. App receives user data and creates/loads player profile
6. User can access all game features
